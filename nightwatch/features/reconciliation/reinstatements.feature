  Background:
    Given I am a logged in user
    And There are no existing centres
    And The following centres exist:
      | name | male_capacity | female_capacity | male_cid_name  | female_cid_name |
      | one  | 1000          | 10000           | oneman,onebman | onewoman        |
    Given I am on the wallboard
    Given The Centre "one" should show the following under "Male":
      | Contractual Capacity   | 1000 |
      | Occupied               | 0    |
      | Beds out of commission | 0    |

      | nationality | abc  |
    And I submit the following "check out" event:
      | centre    | one |
      | person_id | 12  |
